# Overview

A 2D 8-bit HTML5 watery platformer game. You play as Neptune, the
Roman god of the underworld. Minerva, Neptune's historical Roman
rival, has dethroned you and placed you into an aboveground prison;
however, by the time the game starts, you've managed to escape and are
now on the run. Minerva is the goddess of defense and has access to a
whole arsenal of weapons to defeat you, while you only have your
trident.

Neptune will be a level-based game (e.g. not sandboxed) with the first
few levels teaching the player about the game, and slowly getting more
advanced, with the classic Boss battle with Minerva as the finale.

The art style will be 8-bit retro with plenty of pixel animations
(sparks, smoke etc.) Please note that all current art is programmer
art and can (and hopefully will) change at any time.

# Weapons

Neptune's only weapon is his trident, while Minerva has a whole
arsenal of past, present, and futuristic weapons.

## Trident

Neptune's trident is not just a piece of metal; it is a highly capable
electrical stunning device as well as a powerful shield, but _only_
when a) it's underwater, and b) it's charged. The trident can be
charged by picking up a recharge block.

# Health system

You have gills and cannot breathe above water; you have to go
underwater every 15-30 seconds or so to breathe (perhaps have ponds to
aid?)
