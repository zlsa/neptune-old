# Overview

A 2D 8-bit HTML5 watery platformer game.

# Concept

You play as Neptune, the Roman god of the underworld. Minerva,
Neptune's historical Roman rival, has dethroned you and placed you
into an aboveground prison; however, by the time the game starts,
you've managed to escape and are now on the run. Minerva is the
goddess of defense and has access to a whole arsenal of weapons to
defeat you, while you only have your trident.

# Gameplay

Neptune will be a level-based game (e.g. not sandboxed) with the first
few levels teaching the player about the game, and slowly getting more
advanced.

# Art style

8-bit retro with plenty of pixel animations.

# Weapons

## Neptune (player)

Neptune's only weapon is his trident.

### Trident

Neptune's trident is not just a piece of metal; it is a highly capable
electrical stunning device as well as a powerful shield, but _only_
when a) it's underwater, and b) it's charged. The trident can be
charged by picking up a recharge block.

## Minerva (rival)

Minerva is the final boss, and is not seen until the very
end. However, her minions have amassed a vast collection of historic,
modern, and futuristic weapons, and they'll all be used against
you. Here they are, from simplest to most complex.

### Harpoon

Harpoons are rather deadly. Unless removed soon, you die very
rapidly. 

# Health system

You have gills and cannot breathe above water; you have to go
underwater every 15-30 seconds or so to breathe (perhaps have ponds to
aid?)
