# Overview

A 2D 8-bit HTML5 watery platformer game.

# Premise

The name "Neptune" implies oceans; I came up with the idea of a
half-ground, half-ocean game. The adittion of a transition to the
ocean gives us more possibilities such as boats (and things that
float), different dangers above and below water etc.

Basically, you're Neptune, and you've been dethroned and kicked out of
your watery kingdon by Minerva (Neptune's historical Roman
rival). Your goal is to brave your way through Minerva's defenses and
reclaim the crown.

# Weapons

Neptune's trident comes in probably about 1/3 of the way through the
game (to get the player used to the concepts).

# Survival

You have gills and cannot breathe above water; you have to go
underwater every 15-30 seconds or so to breathe (perhaps have ponds to
aid?)
