# Premise

The name "Neptune" implies oceans; I came up with the idea of a
half-ground, half-ocean game. The adittion of a transition to the
ocean gives us more possibilities such as boats (and things that
float), different dangers above and below water etc.

Basically, you're Neptune, and you've been dethroned and kicked out of
your watery kingdon by Bad. Your goal is to brave your way through
Bad's defenses and reclaim the crown.

# Weapons

Neptunes

# Survival

You have gills and can barely breathe above water; you have to go
underwater every fifteen seconds or so to breathe.
